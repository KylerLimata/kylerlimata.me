# Projects
------
{{ position(title="Motion Simulation of 2-Link Robot Arm",duration="November 2023 - December 2023") }}
- Derived equations of motion using Kaneâ€™s method and developed a MATLAB simulation script using AutoLev
- Demonstrated 4 combinations of torque at each joint to achieve high-speed motion of the arm

{{ position(title="Vibration Simulation of 3D Printer",duration="September 2023 - October 2023") }}
- Analyzed the structure of a gantry 3D printer and broke it down into 3 independent vibration models
- Simulated 3D printer structure using MATLAB to demonstrate the vibration characteristics of the model

{{ position(title="Electric Car Machine Learning",duration="July - August 2023") }}
- Co-led team of 4 to train a lookup table controller using python and Q-learning for a simple car simulation
- Optimized hyperparameters to achieve a medium level of stability in controller response

{{ position(title="Spherical Fluid Pulsation Dampener",duration="September 2021 - April 2022") }}
- Produced a prototype Spherical Fluid Pulsation Dampener based on prior research that reduced output pressure by 50% and fluid pulsations by 99% with zero moving parts
- Analyzed both structural stress and the fluid dynamics of the model in ANSYS, ensuring the desired fluid damping effect and structural stability
- Remodeled housing, distributor plate, and receiver plate in Autodesk Inventor to align with testing needs and capabilities
- Utilized mechatronics knowledge to develop Raspberry Pi program to interface with pressure sensors via ADC
