# About Me

Hello! My name is Kyler Limata; I am currently working towards my Master in Mechanical Engineering degree at Saint Martin's University.

My engineering journey started when I was young. From an early age, I was fascinated by mechanical systems and their complexities, particularly robots. This led to me taking two introductory engineering classes in high school.

After High School, I went to Saint Martin's University to study Mechanical Engineering. In 2022, I graduated with my Bachelor's degree and returned to Saint Martin's in 2023 to work on my Master in Mechanical Engineering.

I am currently looking for a role where I can exercise my problem-solving skills and continue to grow and challenge myself as a Mechanical Engineer. While my primary interest is robotics, I am open to any mechatronics, design, or CAD roles.

Outside of engineering, I enjoy reading books and spending time with my family, including taking walks and going on camping trips.
