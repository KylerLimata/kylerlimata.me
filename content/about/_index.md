# About Me

I am a recent graduate of Saint Martin's University with both a Master of Science and a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. I am seeking a role where I can apply my technical skill set to meaningful challenges, contribute to impactful projects, and continue growing as an engineer.

My academic project experience emphasizes modeling, simulation, and analytical problem-solving. I performed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in ANSYS as part of my capstone project, [Spherical Fluid Pulsation Dampener](../projects/spherical-pulsation-dampener/), including both fluid and structural simulations. I also modeled and simulated a [2D robot arm](../projects/robot-arm/) using AutoLev and MATLAB, and automated stress calculations in Python by modeling the loading cycle of a [piston connecting rod](../projects/piston-connecting-rod/) for an internal combustion engines course. Additionally, I completed coursework in both linear and nonlinear optimization with a focus on engineering applications.

I am particularly interested in leveraging computational tools to automate repetitive design calculations, allowing more time to focus on critical engineering decisions. In fast-paced environments where requirements evolve, this approach enables rapid iteration and robust design outcomes.

Thank you for visiting my professional portfolio. If you believe my background aligns with your team’s needs, I would welcome the opportunity to connect via phone, email, or LinkedIn.

Outside of engineering, I enjoy reading, 3D printing, board games, and spending time with my family—especially walking and camping.
