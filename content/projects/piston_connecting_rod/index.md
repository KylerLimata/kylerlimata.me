# Overview
------

As part of my Internal Combustion Engines class, I designed a piston connecting rod for an Otto Cycle engine, including performing a stress analysis at four differenet points of high stress and finite element analysis in FEA. I developed a numerical simulation of the stress in Python so that I could calculate the average and maximum principal stresses (sigma 1) for fatigue analysis. Links to the report and GitHub repository can be found below.
