# Overview
------

As part of my Internal Combustion Engines course, I designed a piston connecting rod, developing parametric stress models and performing fatigue analysis under cyclic loading to guide design decisions. I wrote Python scripts to compute stresses across the full loading cycle at high resolution, enabling rapid iteration of key design parameters. The finalized geometry was modeled in Fusion 360 and exported to ANSYS for finite element stress analysis, where simulation results were compared against analytical predictions to inform stress model refinements.
