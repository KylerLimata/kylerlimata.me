We later wrote and published a technical paper on this project, discussing how our work could inform the design of baseball-pitching robot arms in the ASME IMECE journal."

# Overview
------

As part of a class on modelling and simulation in Fall 2023, I worked with a partner to model and simulated a robot arm as a simplified 2D, 2-link model. To accomplish this, we solved for the equations of motion and the forces on the arm using Kane's method and the software package/domain specific language AutoLev. AutoLev enabled us to perfom the multibody dynamics computations and generate a MATLAB script for simulating the equations of motion.

# Publication
------

In Spring 2024, our modelling and simulation professor Dr. Shawn Duan approached us about publishing our work and tying it into the field of robot arms designed to pitch baseballs, as that was an area he felt was ripe for research. In the article, we discussed how our methodologies and results could be a foundation for future work that would bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical applications.
