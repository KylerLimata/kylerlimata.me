extra.summary = "For a class on Modelling and Simulation, I worked with a partner to model and simulate a two-link, 2D robot arm with AutoLev and MATLAB. We later wrote and published a technical paper on this project, discussing how our work could inform the design of baseball-pitching robot arms in the ASME IMECE journal."
